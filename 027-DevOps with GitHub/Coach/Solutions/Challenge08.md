[< Previous Challenge](./Challenge07.md) - **[Home](../readme.md)** - [Next Challenge>](./Challenge09.md)


## Students should:

1. Switch to the 'Security' tab of GitHub and either click on 'Set up a security policy' or 'View security policy' then use the pencil to edit. Make a change to the policy, then follow steps to merge the change into the repo. 

1. In the 'Security' tab, either enable Dependabot alerts, or ensure they are already on. 

1. UPDATE WHEN CODE SCANNING OUT OF BETA

(NOTE: Skip this step while Code scanning is in Beta.) Finally, set up and run a Code scanning workflow for the repository using GitHub's 'CodeQL Analysis.' This workflow can run either on each pull request or on a schedule, and it checks your code for common vulnerabilities or errors.
